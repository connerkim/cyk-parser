# cyk-parser

## What it Does:
### Implements the CYK (Cocke-Younger-Kasami) Parsing algorithm for context-free grammars. Takes in a set of rules, converts the rules to Chomsky Normal Form, then reads a sentence and determines whether the sentence is valid within the grammar of the rules.

## Why:
### The implementation of this algorithm was an assignment for my Introduction to Machine Translation class. I used Colaboratory for portability reasons, and the AnyTree library to construct parse trees from the various sentences parses.

## How to Build:
### The easiest way to run this project is to use Colaboratory. Add the text files to your Google Drive, then follow this link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kUChCBZb3cicPRd648vbq5YlNL7MSh_v and run each cell of the program.
